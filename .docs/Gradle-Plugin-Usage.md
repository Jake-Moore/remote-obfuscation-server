## Usaging the Gradle Plugin
The gradle plugin for this project aims to assist in your obfuscation needs, including:
- automated obfuscation for your build
- automated watermarking of obfuscated jars
  - including a gradle task for extracting watermark
- automated stacktrace restoration from obfuscated state
  - using a CLI-like gradle task
